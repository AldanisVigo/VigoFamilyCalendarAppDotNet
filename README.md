# Family Calendar Dot Net - What's the project about?

Parents can create accounts and add their children to their accounts. They can then generate child codes to give to their children, and when their children enter the child codes into the registration page, they will be allowed to setup their account for the first time. Parents can then add "incentives/rewards" which are worth a certain number of stars to the reward shop. These will be displayed to all children under the parent account when they shop for rewards. Parents can then also add chores and give each chore a number of stars the child can earn for completing the chore. Children will then be able to claim the stars when they complete that chore. A chore is marked completed when the child provides photographic proof that the chore was completed, and the parent has marked the chore complete on the application. When a child clicks on a chore, he/she will have the ability to upload a video or an image showing the chore was completed, as well as add a note for their parent. Parents can then mark that chore either completed, or incomplete and add a note to the chore. When the chores are completed, the child will receive the number of stars that the chore was worth which they can then spend on the reward shop.
