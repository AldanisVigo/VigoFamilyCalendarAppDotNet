# Family Calendar Dot Net - What's the project about?

Imagine a seamless family app where parents easily create accounts, connect with their kids, and share registration codes. Kids, in turn, use these codes to set up their accounts, explore exciting rewards, and start earning stars. Parents play a role by assigning chores, each with a star value, and kids can claim those stars with a simple proof upload. It gets interactive as completing chores involves sharing a photo, which parents can then confirm. To add a personal touch, kids can even include notes. The stars earned from these chores become a currency of sorts, allowing kids to indulge in the reward shop. It's a hassle-free and engaging way for families to manage tasks together!
